/*
You are given two strings and you have to find an index of the second 
occurrence of the second string in the first one.

Let's go through the first example where you need to find the second 
occurrence of "s" in a word "sims". Itâ€™s easy to find its first occurrence
with a function indexOf which will point out that "s" is the first symbol 
in a word "sims" and therefore the index of the first occurrence is 0. 
But we have to find the second "s" which is 4th in a row and that means 
that the index of the second occurrence (and the answer to a question) is 3.

function secondIndex(text, symbol) {
    var a = text.indexOf(symbol)
    var b = text.indexOf(symbol, a + 1)
    if(b === -1){
        return null;
    }else{
        return b
    }
}

secondIndex("sims", "s")
